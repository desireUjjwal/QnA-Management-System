ER Diagram Overview
This ER diagram visually represents the structure and relationships of the forum database. The Student table stores profiles of students participating in the forum, while the Expert table contains details of subject matter experts who respond to queries. The Statistics table provides performance insights for each expert, including the number of questions answered, total upvotes received, and overall satisfaction rate.

The Question table logs all questions posted by students, and the Answer table captures the corresponding responses from experts. User engagement is further tracked through the Vote table, which records upvotes or other voting activity on answers, and the Comments table, which stores user feedback and discussions related to specific answers.

Together, these interconnected tables form a robust foundation for managing forum activity, enabling efficient tracking of users, content, and community interactions.
